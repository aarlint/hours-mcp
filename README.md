## Key Database Relationships

- **Clients** are the core entity with complete address information (rates moved to contracts)
- **Contracts** define billing relationships with specific rates, terms, and duration per client engagement
- **Recipients** are contact persons at each client organization (many-to-one with clients)
- **Payment Details** store banking and payment terms information (one-to-one with clients)
- **Time Entries** track billable hours with UUID identifiers linked to both contracts and clients
- **Invoices** group time entries for billing with automatic numbering (many-to-one with clients)
- **Business Info** is a singleton containing your company information for invoice headers
- **Migrations** track database schema changes for safe upgrades

### Contract-Based Architecture
The system uses a professional contract-based billing model where:
- Each client can have multiple contracts with different rates and terms
- Time entries are logged against specific contracts, not just clients
- Invoices are generated per contract, allowing separate billing for different engagements
- Historical rate changes are preserved through contract versioning
